# My Qlik Project

A simple starter project for Qlik Sense apps and visualizations.

## IMPORTANT
**This project was not conceived by me; it was entirely created based on the video lesson from the YouTube channel "Bix Tecnologia". Therefore, this repository was created during my study and practice of the content of that video lesson related to "Data Week 2024". Here is the link to the video:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLy4l43SdNE&t=4527s>.
